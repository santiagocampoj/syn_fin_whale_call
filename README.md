1)	Fine whale synth database creation
Different functions. Within a +-1 range, to introduce irregularities to get closer to the real-world data. Change acoustic parameters to create different real data among them: the way we model the signal. Decay, etc. Create 2 types of signal 
Downsweep  50Hz
Pulse  20Hz


2)  Insertion of the synthetic fin whale calls into a sea actual recording:
-	Regulazraized amplitud. 
-	SNR, within a specific range so that we can see the variability of the model and get close to the real data
